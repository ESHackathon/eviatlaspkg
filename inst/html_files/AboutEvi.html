<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c5"><span class="c6">eviatlas is an Open Source tool for creating and hosting visualisations from databases of studies created within systematic maps and systematic reviews. The tool was created as part of the  <a class="c7" href="https://www.eshackathon.org">Evidence Synthesis Hackathon</a> series of events, which support the development of cross-disciplinary, free-to-use tools for systematic reviews and maps.</span></p>

<p class="c5"><span class="c0">eviatlas allows users to create a suite of visualisations from a database of studies, including Evidence Atlases (interactive geographical maps showing studies and their details over space), Heat Maps (cross tabulations of categorical variables that highlight clusters and gaps in the evidence), descriptive plots that help to visualise the evidence base (e.g. the number of publications per year), and human-readable databases that are easily filterable.</span></p>

<p class="c5"><span class="c6">This interface was built in the <a class="c7" href="https://www.r-project.org/">R statistical language</a> using <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">Shiny</a>.</span></p>
